Introduction to PyniteFields
****************************

PyniteFields is a Python 3 package for working with finite fields (also called
Galois fields). It is meant to work similar to the Mathematica FiniteFields
package, but in a much friendlier environment and with everything else good
that exists in Python.

PyniteFields is actively under development; if you want to help, by all means
